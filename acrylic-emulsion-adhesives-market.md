<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Emulsion Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volatile Curing</li><li>Water Curing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic emulsion adhesives are categorized into two main types based on their curing mechanisms: volatile curing and water curing. Volatile curing adhesives rely on the evaporation of solvents during the drying process, forming strong bonds as the adhesive solidifies. In contrast, water curing adhesives utilize water as the primary solvent, allowing for a more environmentally friendly option that cures through evaporation and chemical reaction with moisture in the air. Both types are used across various applications, including construction, automotive, and packaging industries.</p></p>
