<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micro wind turbine market features two primary types: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs, characterized by their horizontal blades and high-efficiency performance, are typically used in larger-scale applications and are more common due to their higher energy output. In contrast, VAWTs have a vertical orientation which allows them to capture wind from any direction and are often favored for urban environments due to their compact design and lower noise levels.</p></p>
